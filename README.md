## 💡 Inspiration
In the wake of natural disasters, communication infrastructure often fails. Centralized servers go down, and traditional banking systems become inaccessible. **ReliefMesh** was born to answer one critical question: **"How can we coordinate rescue and funding when the internet is broken?"**

## 🚀 What is ReliefMesh?
ReliefMesh is an **offline-first, peer-to-peer (P2P) disaster management platform**. It allows victims to broadcast SOS signals that hop between devices without needing a central server. Simultaneously, it integrates **Ethereum Smart Contracts** to enable direct, transparent, and fee-free financial aid from donors to victims.

## ✨ Key Features
* **📡 Unstoppable P2P Mesh:** Powered by **Gun.js**, allowing devices to sync emergency data directly.
* **💸 Direct Crypto Aid:** Donations via **MetaMask** on **Sepolia Testnet** (Zero fees, Instant transfer).
* **🗺️ Live Command Center:** Real-time map visualization of SOS clusters.
* **📱 Cross-Device Sync:** Works seamlessly between Mobile and Desktop via Relay.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
* **P2P Database:** Gun.js
* **Blockchain:** Ethers.js, Sepolia Testnet
* **Maps:** Leaflet, OpenStreetMap
* **Tunneling:** Ngrok (For public demo)
